# GliiInDISPENSAbili - Handouts Repository 📚
## USI Master of Artificial Intelligence

Thank you for visiting this temporary repository! Here, you'll find **previews of notes and handouts** I've created to study. They are extremely useful since they speed up the process of studying on slides. These are not summaries or in-class notes, but well-written handouts that merge lecture recoridngs and slides (as well as additional explanations if needed). Feel free to navigate trough the previews hosted on this github repository to see if they may come handy. If you are interested in the full handouts, contact me (button below).

> ### ⚠️ Important Notice
> Preview serve only to see how the handouts are made and if they may be of interest.
> For security and privacy reasons, only **preview versions** are available in this repository. If you're interested in accessing the full materials, see the contact details below. The handouts are mostly given per person and printed.
> The handouts may contain refuses, grammar and syntax error as well as conceptual errors or misunderatndings: I am human, I can make mistakes, if something does not click in your head, check it by yourself.
